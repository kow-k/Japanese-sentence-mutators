<h1>Japanese Sentence Mutator (or more exactly Mutation Simulator)</h1>

<p>
This example page shows how to use named anchors to implement a Table Of
Contents for easy navigation within a single page.
</p>

<h2><a name="TOC">Table Of Contents:</a></h2>
<ul type=disc>
   <li><a href="#whatis">What Is JPNSM?</a></li>
   <li><a href="#whygreat">Why Is JPNSM So Great?</a></li>
   <li><a href="#whouses">Who Uses JPNSM?</a></li>
   <li><a href="#moreinfo">How Can I Find Out More?</a></li>
</ul>

<!-- The <HR> tag creates a horizontal rule, which is a convenient section divider -->
<hr>

<!--
   For each section, there is a named anchor tag, then the contents. The
   section heading is enclosed in the named anchor tag, so that when the
   user navigates to this section, the heading will appear at the top of
   the screen.

   For the user's convenience, there's also a link back to the main table
   of contents, and a horizontal rule separator.

   If you click on the function popup (the icon just to the right of the
   pencil), JPNSM will show you all of the named anchors and headings in a
   popup menu. You can jump straight to a named anchor or heading simply by
   choosing it from this menu. Note that headings appear in the popup menu
   with the heading level in the left-hand column; for example level two
   headings have a "2" in the menu.
